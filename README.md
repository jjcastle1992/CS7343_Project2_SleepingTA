Running Project 1 (The Sleeping Teaching Assistant)

This exercise has been pre-coded. Simply run the code and it should
go through the simulation. 

If you'd like, you can change some of the student variables at the top of main including:
* numStudents - Sets the number of students (default set to 4)
* minAssignmentCompletionTime - sets the minimum amount of time students spend on their assignments (default set to 10)
* maxAssignmentCompletionTime - sets the maximum amount of time students spend on their assignments (default set to 100)

You can also set the study quantum via the STUDYTIME global variable at the top of the file (set by 10 to default)
